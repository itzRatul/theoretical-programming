# Theoretical Programming

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)

A collection of **essential programming concepts** and **theoretical implementations**, written with clarity and optimization in mind. This repository aims to bridge the gap between *theory* and *practical coding* — showing how core ideas transform into real, working programs.

---

## 📘 About

This repository is a curated collection of small, focused programs that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts. These are **not** competitive programming problems — rather, they’re concise examples that help you understand *why* and *how* programming logic works beneath the surface.

---

## 💡 What You’ll Learn

* Core data structures and algorithms explained through clean examples.
* Theoretical programming concepts turned into runnable code.
* Optimized, readable implementations emphasizing **time and space complexity**.
* Modern best practices in **C++** and **Python**.

---

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools

* **C++ (Modern C++17+)** — memory-efficient, structured implementations.
* **Python 3** — clear, concise, and beginner-friendly explanations.

You may also find test snippets or helper utilities for demonstration purposes.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! You can:

1. Open an issue to suggest a topic or improvement.
2. Add a new concept implementation (with short explanation and complexity note).
3. Follow consistent formatting and naming conventions.

> Keep code **clean**, **documented**, and **concept-focused**.

## ✍️ Coding Style

* **Readable > Clever** — clarity first, always.
* Document complexity (`O(n)`, `O(log n)`, etc.).
* Use meaningful names and brief comments.
* For C++ → prefer RAII, STL, and modern constructs.
* For Python → prefer idiomatic and type-hinted code where useful.
